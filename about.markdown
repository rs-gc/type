We want to make people more **productive** by allowing them to do multiple things at the same time.

We want to allow people to read anything they are browsing, seeing or reading. We want to be in a position where the user should be able to hear the text rather than reading it.

If you want to learn something new but finding it hard to find time in your busy schedule then our app will help you to make a set routine helping you to attain your goals.

To tackle the problem, we started off as a platform which used to provide simple audio-based articles in different categories for the users.

The response we got from our users was awesome. They really liked the content that we were sharing with our users.

We soon came up with the chrome extension which really was our first step toward achieving the big goal that we had in our mind, allowing all our users to **hear anything**.

Our chrome extension can be downloaded using [this link.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pladio/bgecfahjghhjiddinkiolpanfkpdfhco)

We still are figuring a lot of stuff out. You can ping us anytime. We will be happy to help.

Regards
Team Pladio

Pladio came to the market with the tagline of making the people more productive by providing tools for the users to hear articles rather than reading something.

According to the stats, the average person spends more time reading some sort of articles rather than doing some actual work.

Our Android app, along with our chrome extension will help you to hear whatever you want to read in a simple and easy way. Just click on a few buttons and you are done.

Our legendary subtitle feature will help you to follow through the content that you are hearing, adding your ability to remember the text that you have already read.

You can simply login on the chrome extension and Android app using Google login with just one click.

We are trying to develop the adding of Pladio docs from Android app itself.

Also, we are working on building the web app itself, which will allow our users to read the content without downloading the app as well.

Please download the android app and leave a 5-star rating on the play store:

Here is the link to the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.pladio.android&rdid=co.pladio.android

After launching the app we received a few good reviews on the play store, that we want to share:

> Hi Pladio team Thanks for this awesome app. After using this app I am saving hours of time daily. Plus this has done wonders on my eye health. Just facing a small issue, after closing the app, the audio player has to be stopped automatically. I believe there must be an API to do that. Finally, thanks for saving my eyes! Cheers

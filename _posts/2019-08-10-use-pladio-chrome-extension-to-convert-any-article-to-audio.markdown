Now, you can convert any text on the chrome to audio using our chrome extension.

Just get the chrome extension from the following [link.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pladio/bgecfahjghhjiddinkiolpanfkpdfhco)

## What are the features of the chrome extension

We came out with the simplest feature that aligns with the vision that we have for our users.

We want our users to be able to hear anything they are reading. Our first step toward achieving that goal is to make the users at least hear the web pages that they are watching every day.

Researchers believe that your retention power can drastically increase if are hearing something along with reading it.

Our subtitle service will help you solve the retention issues as well. You can easily follow the words along as they pop up on the screen.

## How our chrome extension works

As soon as you download the chrome extension and add to your chrome, you will see our icon being added to your chrome extension.

You can click on any of the pages that you are browsing and click on the save button to save the URL and Title onto your profile.

Before saving anything you will have to log in so that we can find out who this page belongs to.

Once you save the page, we get the request and start converting the page to audio, it generally takes no more than 2 minutes to complete that task.

Once done you can see the article popping up in the library section of the Android app.

## Future Plans

Our future plans for the chrome extension are pretty simple. We will need everyone's support in that. Please leave a review whenever you want to suggest something to us or something is not working.

Also, if you liked the product, feel free to give a 5-star rating on the play store and chrome webstore.

Also, please share this product as much as possible.
